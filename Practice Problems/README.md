# Practice Problems

The jupyter notebooks in this folder contain practice problems that expand upon the theoretical background of the lecture material and offer opportunities to practice what you have learned.

Most, but not all, notebooks will have a "Complete" and an empty version. The empty version has spots left blank for you to record your answers, the "Complete" versions have sample solutions that you can use to check your answers.
