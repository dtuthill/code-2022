    "That's right because `a` and `b` were pointing to the same list object in your memory, if you change `b`, then you also change `b`. This process is known as making a <i>shallow copy</i> of `a`. It is shallow because we are not making a true copy of what is stored in the variable `a`, but rather pointing to the object stored in `a`. If our python object is mutable, then when we change the shallow copy we also change the original. If we want a true duplicate copy we have to make a <i>deep copy</i>. For `list`s we can do that like so."
