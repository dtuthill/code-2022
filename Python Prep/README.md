# Python Prep

This folder contains our python prep content. These are all notebooks designed to teach various aspects of python that will be needed at various points over the course of the boot camp. Those who already feel confident with their python skills can also use these notebooks to see what is expected as a base level knowledge prior to the start of the boot camp. 


## Lecture Notebooks

The jupyter notebooks in this folder are meant to be completed in the following order:
0. Introduction
1. My First jupyter notebook
2. Basic Data Types
3. Strings
4. More Complicated Data Types
5. Shallow and Deep Copies
6. Conditionals and Loops
7. Writing Functions
8. Reading and Writing to File
9. Importing a Module or Package
10. Basic numpy
11. Basic pandas
12. Basic Plotting
13. Troubleshooting Errors
14. Next Steps
15. Classes and Objects in Python (Optional)

Each notebook in this folder has two versions, one in which exercises have been left blank and another where exercises have been completed.

You may complete these notebooks on your own, or you can follow along with our pre-recorded video lectures, <a href="https://www.erdosinstitute.org/data-science">https://www.erdosinstitute.org/data-science</a>.

## Practice Problems

When you feel like you have mastered a particular concept covered in the lecture notebooks, check out the Practice Problems folder. This folder features a series of notebooks with problems that test your comprehension.

## Final Python Prep Note

For those of you that are looking to tackle all of the notebooks in this folder, <b>I encourage you to space this out</b>. This is a lot of content, especially if you are new to python. You want to be able to digest it in palatable bites. 

Perhaps even more importantly, <i>do not get discouraged!</i> Coding is hard and it takes time to get comfortable with something new. Be kind to yourself as you are going through and ask for help if you need it.
