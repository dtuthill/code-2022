    "## Rationale for data splits\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal of predictive modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we are solving a predictive modeling problem, as we soon will. Once we have identified the problem we go out and randomly collect some data, $(X,y)$, say $n$ observations of $m$ features and $n$ corresponding outputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to use these data to identify a model with the lowest <i>generalization error</i>. Generalization error is defined to be the error of the model on a new randomly collected set $(X^*, y^*)$. If we fix this new data set, then the fact that the data we collected originally, $(X,y)$, was randomly collected makes the generalization error of any particular model a random variable. Let's call this variable $G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the \"best\" model from a set of candidate models we would want to choose the one such that the corresponding $G$ is smallest. In other words for each candidate model we want to know something about the corresponding $G$ and its distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an ideal world we would simply collect many sets, $(X,y)$, fit our models on each of them and compare the resulting distributions. However, it may not be practical, possible or ethical to continually collect data for model selection purposes. In practice, thus, we are often constrained to a single data set for model fitting and comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data splits\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to estimate $G$ we typically split our data (often more than once) so that we can use one part of the split to fit or estimate the model and the other part to estimate $G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "These splits are typically random because we want to be able to assume that the data used to fit the model follows the same distribution as the data used to measure generalization performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now cover three splitting steps/strategies employed in data science and machine learning."

    "## Train test splits\n",
    "\n",
    "The first split we will touch on is the first split you would do in a new data science project, the <i>train test split</i>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the train test split is to create two data sets:\n",
    "1. <b>The training set</b> - This subset is used to fit models and compare model candidates. This data set is usually split further.\n",
    "2. <b>The testing set</b> - This subset is used as a final check on your selected model prior to putting your model into its desired final state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training set usually contains the majority of the original data. Common train test split percentage divisions are $80\\% - 20\\%$ or $75\\% - 25\\%$, but it may sometimes be appropriate to use different split sizes. Train test splits are done randomly, with the form of randomness dependent upon your project.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### A potential point of confusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps confusingly, the test set is not directly used to compare models, model comparison is typically done using a subset(s) of the training set as we will soon see. The main purpose of the test is to serve as a final check on your chosen model. This final check is important! Checking model performance on the test set let's you look for coding/modeling errors as well as <i>overfitting</i> on the training set (we will talk about this more explicitly soon).\n",

    "The validation set approach in essence gives us a <i>point estimate</i> of $G$. An issue with this approach for model selection is that point estimates are not always reflective of overall or even average model performance. What would be really nice is knowing something about the distribution from which $G$ is drawn. While this is difficult, we can leverage a well known rule from probability theory called the <i>law of large numbers</i>.\n",

Enter $k$-fold cross-validation.\n",

    "After conducting your train test split, you will randomly break your training set into $k$ equally sized (or roughly equal depending on how the division works out) chunks. You then generate \"observations\" of $G$ by cycling through each of the $k$ chunks. For each chunk you train your model on the $k-1$ other chunks and then calculate the error of that model on the chunk you held out. At the end you will have $k$ observations of $G$.
