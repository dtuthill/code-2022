    "# General Presentation Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will review several tips for a successful data science project presentation. While these tips will serve you well in any presentation setting, they are particularly geared for the boot camp's pre-recorded project presentation video. Over the past three years we have viewed hundreds of pre-recorded presentation videos and these tips touch on aspects of those videos that were and were not successful."

    "## Time limits\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think back on all of the presentations/classes you have attended, there are probably many times that the presenter/teacher went over their allotted presentation/class time. While there were likely instances where you were fine with this, there were probably a number of times that the presenter's poor temporal planning inconvenienced you in some way or another. Going over a set time limit can break an otherwise excellent presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key tip here is:\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote>\n",
    "    If your presentation has a set time limit, make sure that your presentation is at or slightly under that limit.\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "That is not to say that it is always inexcusable to go over your given time, but this is a good rule of thumb to follow. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, for your five minute pre-recorded presentation the following times are examples of <i>acceptable</i> video lengths:\n",
    "- 4:45,\n",
    "- 4:53,\n",
    "- 4:57,\n",
    "- 5:00,\n",
    "- 5:03 and even\n",
    "- 5:10,\n",
    "\n",
    "although some people may not like the ten second overage on that last one. Video lengths to <i>avoid</i> are:\n",
    "- 5:30,\n",
    "- 5:47,\n",
    "- 5:55,\n",
    "- 6:30 and\n",
    "- 10:00+."

    "## Telling a story\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote>\n",
    "    Good presentations often tell a good story.\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the phrase <i>good story</i> does not refer to your ability as an orator to spin a tale as timeless as <u>the Iliad</u> or <u>the Odyssey</u>, rather it refers to your ability to <i>clearly and concisely confer what your project is about to your audience.</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common features of a \"good story\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Clear problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Early in your presentation you should give your audience a clear problem statement. This should be done in as close to an \"elevator pitch\" form as you can. If you are unfamiliar with the phrase \"elevator pitch\", it means a short one to two sentence description that you would be able to tell someone while riding with them from one floor to another on an elevator.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is typical to provide some amount of motivation for your problem statement. This motivation should include an identification of the stakeholders of the problem, i.e. who would care the most about this problem and your proposed solution, and how they would benefit from your solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>If your time limit permits</i> you can also include some background on what approaches, if any, have been attempted in the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we tried to frame this like an academic paper, this could loosely be considered your \"Introduction\" section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What you did (or tried to do)\n",
    "\n",
    "After stating your problem you should give a summary of how you attempted to \"solve\" this problem. How in depth you get should depend upon:\n",
    "- Your time limit (see above) and\n",
    "- Your audience (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "Common topics in this section include:\n",
    "- Briefly explaining the data you had or the data you needed to collect, \n",
    "- What modeling approaches you took and\n",
    "- How you decided to gauge model performance once those models were fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important facet here is explaining things in a way that relates back to your problem statement and the stakeholders when possible. For example, if you worked on a classification problem, you could touch on why you chose to focus on certain performance metrics because of their relevance to the original problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going back to our academic paper analogy, this is kind of like your \"Methods\" section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What happened?\n",
    "\n",
    "After laying out your approach to solving the problem, it is time to tell your audience how that approach went. \n",
    "\n",
    "The specifics on what you touch on in this portion of the presentation again depends on your time limit and your audience, but it should all be in service of telling the story of your project. What I mean by this is to not include sidetracks that may not directly relate to your overall problem statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, this section does not need to only include your project's successes. Sometimes your project may have encountered difficulties which made attaining success difficult. In such a scenario you may want to highlight what made this problem difficult. Highlighting difficulties can shed light on future directions you may want to take should you continue to work on this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning to the academic paper analogy, think of this as your \"Results\" section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Comparisons and future directions\n",
    "\n",
    "A common follow up to 3. is touching on what you would do to continue working on your project or how you would build upon your results. You may also want to make comparisons to existing approaches to this problem, if any.\n",
    "\n",
    "If, hypothetically, you completely solved this particular problem, it is okay to not have any future directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, if your project encountered difficulties, this would be the time to highlight what approaches you would take to alleviate those difficulties. For example, maybe your data set included very unclean data and a majority of your project work time was spent focusing on data cleaning. You could outline how a worthwhile next step would be to write streamlined cleaning code which will quickly automate any future data collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of this as the \"Discussion\" section of your academic paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Summary and Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the final portion of your presentation. The summary and conclusion should include succinct versions of:\n",
    "- Your problem statement,\n",
    "- What you attempted,\n",
    "- What you accomplished and\n",
    "- A conclusion statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be the last thing your audience sees, so you want to make sure that the narrative arc of your project is presented in as clear a way as possible while highlighting the most important takeaway messages you want the audience to have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fittingly, this is the equivalent of a \"Conclusion\" section of an academic paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Acknowledgements\n",
    "\n",
    "A final acknowledgements slide is customary as well. Here you would thank anyone you believe deserves acknowledgement."

    "</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "This step is crucial. You may have one of the most successful approaches to solving problem X of all time, but if you do not convey it in a manner that your audience can comprehend your presentation was a failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example consider how you would present your academic research results to these two groups: \n",
    "- A conference room of researchers actively working in your field and \n",
    "- An undergraduate introduction to research seminar.\n",
    "\n",
    "When presenting to the former you would go into much greater detail about the technical aspects of your results, while for the latter you would likely just give a broad overview.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same process holds for industry settings. If you are presenting to your fellow data scienctists you may dive more into the details of your models/algorithms/analysis. By contrast if you are presenting to management or some non-technical team members you may give a broader assessment of the problem and how you are solving it."

    "## Slide tips\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will detail some tips on slide preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Be clear and concise\n",
    "\n",
    "Slides are not the same as a paper or book. You do not need to use full sentences and should avoid paragraphs of text. In most cases people will not be able to both read a wall of text and listen to you speak. Find a good balance of clearly conveying your content and conciseness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Clearly visible non-blurry plots/tables\n",
    "\n",
    "If you include plots, figures or tables ensure that they are:\n",
    "- Clearly labeled,\n",
    "- Not blurry,\n",
    "- Have easy to read tick labels and \n",
    "- Are not distorted by the transfer from image file to powerpoint slide.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `2. Plotting Tips` we give some tips for creating presentation plots in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Include relevant information\n",
    "\n",
    "What I mean here is that you should always include relevant information regarding:\n",
    "- Who worked on your project,\n",
    "- Where someone can find your slides and\n",
    "- Where people can find any supplementary materials regarding your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you project includes a corresponding GitHub repository, be sure to include the link for that repository on the first and last slides.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, <i>include the full text for such links, do not just include a clickable icon.</i> Not everyone will intuite that the icon is clickable and some people may not be able to click it, depending on how they are consuming your slides.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Include all important points\n",
    "\n",
    "You should not assume that any audience member will consume additional information about your project outside of your presentation. So if you have a point that you think is crucial to the story of your project, include it in the presentation. Do not relegate important points to supplementary materials, because the vast majority of your audience will not look at those."

    "## Practice!\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote>\n",
    "    Do not let the audience see the first time your make the presentation.\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "You should practice your presentation a few times before you give it live or record it for your audience. Practicing gives you the opportunity to rehearse what you are going to say as well as work out any unforseen kinks in the presentation <i>before</i> you get in front of your audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "If possible, it can help to practice your presentation with somebody that is not as familiar with the project. Enlisting the help of somebody that is not as acquainted with your project can open your eyes to \"plot holes\", that is gaps in your presentation that you missed. This happens to the best of us, and practicing allows us to catch the mistake before we make it come presentation day."
