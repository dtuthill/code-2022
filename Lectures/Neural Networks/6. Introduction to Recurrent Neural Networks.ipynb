The exact details are slightly beyond the scope of our boot camp and better suited for a natural language processing course, here are the docs on the `Embedding` layer, <a href=\"https://keras.io/api/layers/core_layers/embedding/\">https://keras.io/api/layers/core_layers/embedding/</a>. <i>Note: the `Embedding` layer is specific to NLP tasks, and not used if you are building a RNN on time series data.
