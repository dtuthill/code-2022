# Problem Sessions

This folder will contain the problem sets that we will work through in our problem solving sessions. Everyday the empty notebook(s) for that session will be posted along with sample solutions for the previous day's notebook(s).

Problems will be worked on in small groups while Matt and TAs will circulate to observe your thought process and answer any questions that pop up.

Each problem session also has an optional preparation notebook in the <i>Prep Notebooks</i> folder. These notebooks have some short exercises touching on key python concepts that are pertinent to the corresponding problem session notebook. Again these are optional, but may be worth your time if you are new to python.
